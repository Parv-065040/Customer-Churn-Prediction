# Bank Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)

## Business Problem
Bank customer churn (attrition) is a critical metric. Acquiring a new customer costs 5x more than retaining an existing one. This project uses Deep Learning to predict which customers are at high risk of leaving.

## Solution
We built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow to analyze customer demographics and financial behavior.

## Technologies
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras (Sequential ANN)
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud
- **Data Processing:** Pandas & Scikit-Learn

## How to Use
1. Enter the customer's Credit Score, Balance, and Tenure.
2. The model outputs a "Risk Probability".
3. Managers can use this to offer retention incentives to high-risk clients.
